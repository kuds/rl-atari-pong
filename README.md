# Playing Atari's Pong with Reinforcement Learning

## Training Notes
- When training with Google Colab Notebooks with high memory option enabled, try not to exceed the buffer size `850,000` as you can run into memory issues
- When training in more complex environments or using multiple simulated environments (`n_evn` > 1), DQN is very sensitive to the hyperparameter settings
